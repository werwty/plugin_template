Live APIs
=========

The Pulp 3 Plugin API allows plugin writers to add a web views that can respond to client requests
and facilitate content discovery. Conceptually, this is called a "Live API". Not many content types
require this, but if they do, it's important to understand what the requirements are.

Typically only published content needs to be discovered, so the "Live API" requirement is thought of
as a publishing requirement.

**NOTE:** Write down any requirements for a webserver to interact with a client to facilitate content discovery.
