<!-- TEMPLATE_REMOVE_START -->

This is the ``plugin_template`` repository to help plugin writers get started and write their own
plugin for [Pulp Project 3.0+](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/).


# Plugin Writing Walkthrough

If you are planning on writing a new Pulp plugin, but have no idea what you're doing you've come to the right place.
The purpose of this guide is to walk you through, step by step, the Pulp plugin creation process.

This guide specifically details *how* you write a new content plugin.

[*Why* would you want to write a plugin?](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/plugins/index.html)

[*What* exactly is this Pulp thing?](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/overview/concepts.html)

It's recommend that you develop on a system that already has
[Pulp installed](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/installation/instructions.html).
This allows you to test your plugin at every step.

It's also recommended that you go through the [planning guide](meta_docs/planning-guide.md) before starting to develop your plugin.

# Bootstrap a new Pulp plugin

The first step is to bootstrap this template. This will create a functional but useless plugin,
with minimal code, docs, and tests. Later on we'll discuss exactly what each part of this template does and what to
change to create a 'real' plugin.

1. Clone this repository

   ``$ git clone https://github.com/pulp/plugin_template.git``

   ``$ cd plugin_template``

2. Run the provided ``bootstrap.py`` script to create a skeleton for your plugin with the name of your choice.
   It will contain a ``setup.py``, expected plugin layout and stubs for necessary classes and methods, minimal docs,
   and tests.

   ``$ ./bootstrap.py your_plugin_name``


   **NOTE** : Whatever you choose for `your_plugin_name` will be prefixed with `pulp_`.
   Therefore, for this argument it is best to just provide the content type
   which you would like to support, e.g. `rubygem` or `maven`.


In addition to the basic plugin boilerplate, this template also provides a basic set of
functional tests using the [pulp_smash](https://pulp-smash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework,
and a Travis configuration file / scripts for continuous integration. These are highly recommended,
as they will make continuous verification of your plugin's functionality much easier.

In order to use these tests, you will need to address the "FIXME" messages left in places where
plugin-writer intervention is required.


## Discoverability

After bootstrapping, your plugin should be installable and discoverable by Pulp.

1. Install your bootstrapped plugin

    `pip install -e your_plugin_name`

2. Start/restart the Pulp Server

    `django-admin runserver`

3. Check that everything worked and you have a remote endpoint

    `$ http GET http://localhost:8000/pulp/api/v3/remotes/plugin-template/`


The plugin specific `/pulp/api/v3/publishers/plugin-template/` and `/pulp/api/v3/content/plugin-template/` endpoints
should now also be available, and you can validate this by checking the hosted docs
http://localhost:8000/pulp/api/v3/docs

Your plugin is discoverable by Pulp because it is [a Django application that subclasses
pulpcore.plugin.PulpPluginAppConfig](pulp_plugin_template/app/__init__.py)

For more information about plugin discoverability, including how it works and plugin
entrypoints see [the discoverability documentation](meta_docs/discoverability.md)


# Customizing Plugin Behavior

First, look at the [overview](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/plugins/plugin-writer/first-plugin.html#understanding-models) of Pulp Models to understand how Pulp fits these pieces together.

Bootstrapping created three new endpoints (remote, publisher, and content). Additional information should be added to these
to tell Pulp how to handle your content.

For each of these three endpoints, the bootstrap has created a `model`, a `serializer` and a `viewset`.
The [model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/models/) is how the data is stored in the database.
The [serializer](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/) converts complex data to easily parsable types (XML, JSON).
The [viewset](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/) provides the handlers to serve/receive the serialized data.

## Subclassing Content, Remote, Publisher

Always subclass the relevant model, serializer, and viewset from the `pulpcore.plugin`
namespace. Pulp provides custom behavior for these, and although implementation details
are located in `pulpcore.app`, plugins should always use `pulpcore.plugin` instead,
since `pulpcore.plugin` gurantees the plugin API semantic versioning

Models:
 * model(s) for the specific content type(s) used in plugin, should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.models.Content](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/models/content.py) model
 * model(s) for the plugin specific remote(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.models.Remote](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/models/repository.py) model
 * model(s) for the plugin specific publisher(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.models.Publisher](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/models/repository.py) model

Serializers:
 * serializer(s) for plugin specific content type(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.serializers.ContentSerializer](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/serializers/content.py)
 * serializer(s) for plugin specific remote(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.serializers.RemoteSerializer](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/serializers/repository.py)
 * serializer(s) for plugin specific publisher(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.serializers.PublisherSerializer](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/serializers/repository.py)

Viewsets:
 * viewset(s) for plugin specific content type(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.ContentViewSet](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/viewsets/content.py)
 * viewset(s) for plugin specific remote(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.RemoteViewset](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/viewsets/repository.py)
 * viewset(s) for plugin specific publisher(s), should be subclassed from [pulpcore.plugin.viewsets.PublisherViewset](https://github.com/pulp/pulp/blob/master/pulpcore/pulpcore/app/viewsets/repository.py)

Keep [namespacing](meta_docs/subclassing/namespacing.md) in mind when writing your viewsets.

## Content

### Model

First model your content type. This file is located at [pulp_plugin_template/app/models.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/models.py).
Add any fields that correspond to the metadata of your content, the could be the project name, the author name, or any other type of metadata.

The ``TYPE`` class attribute is used for filtering purposes.
If a uniqueness constraint is needed, add a ``Meta`` class to the model like so:

```
class PluginTemplateContent(Content):
    TYPE = 'plugin-template'
    filename = models.TextField(unique=True, db_index=True, blank=False)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('filename',)
```

After adding the model, you can run the migration with

`pulp-manager makemigrations pulp_plugin_template`

And make sure all your fields are on the pulp_plugin_template database table.

### Serializer

Next, add a corresponding serializer field on the in [pulp_plugin_template/app/serializers.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/serializers.py).
See the [DRF documentation on serializer fields to see what's available](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/)


### Viewset

Last, add any additional routes to your [pulp_plugin_template/app/viewsets.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/viewsets.py).
The content viewset usually doesn't require any additinal routes, so you can leave this alone for now.


## Remote

A remote knows specifics of the plugin Content to put it into Pulp. Remote defines how to synchronize remote content.
Pulp Platform provides support for concurrent downloading of remote content. Plugin writer is encouraged to use one of
them but is not required to.

### Model

First model your remote. This file is located at [pulp_plugin_template/app/models.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/models.py).
Add any fields that correspond to the remote source.

Remember to define the ``TYPE`` class attribute which is used for filtering purposes,

### Serializer

Next, add a corresponding serializer field on the in [pulp_plugin_template/app/serializers.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/serializers.py).

### Viewset

Last, add any additional routes to your [pulp_plugin_template/app/viewsets.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/viewsets.py).
Note the sync route is predefined for you. This route kicks off a task [pulp_plugin_template.app.tasks.synchronizing.py](pulp_plugin_template.app.tasks.synchronizing.py).

## Publisher

### Model
e. This file is located at [pulp_plugin_template/app/models.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/models.py).
Add any additional fields.

Make sure you define the ``TYPE`` class attribute which is used for filtering purposes,

### Serializer
Next, add a corresponding serializer field on the in [pulp_plugin_template/app/serializers.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/serializers.py).

### Viewset

Last, add any additional routes to your [pulp_plugin_template/app/viewsets.py](pulp_plugin_template/app/viewsets.py).
Note the publish route is predefined for you. This route kicks off a task [pulp_plugin_template.app.tasks.publishing.py](pulp_plugin_template.app.tasks.publishing.py).

# Exporter

# Tasks

[Tasks](meta_docs/tasks/index.md) such as sync and publish are needed to tell Pulp how to perform certain actions.

# Documentation

Your bootstrap template comes with a set of [prepopulated docs](docs/). You can host these on readthedocs when you are ready.

Pulp also comes with a set of [auto API docs](meta_docs/reference/documentation.md). When your plugin is installed endpoints in the live api docs will be automatically populate.
